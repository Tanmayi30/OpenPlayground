# Quantum Singularity – Spacetime Curvature Visualizer

A 3D visualization of spacetime curvature around a quantum singularity, inspired by general relativity and black hole physics.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization using Three.js
- Dynamic spacetime grid that curves around the singularity
- Orbit controls for exploring the scene
- Animated curvature effects

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser that supports WebGL.

## Controls

- Mouse: Rotate and zoom the view
- Scroll: Zoom in/out

## Technical Details

- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses a wireframe plane geometry to represent spacetime
- Vertex positions are updated in real-time to simulate gravitational curvature
- The singularity is represented by a black sphere at the center

## Physics Inspiration

This visualization demonstrates the concept of spacetime curvature near a massive object, where the fabric of space bends, creating the effect we see as gravity. Near a singularity, this curvature becomes extreme.
